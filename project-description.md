***Trangulate***

*Project Description*

Trangulate is a song that has 3 different parts. It is a reflection to the main 3 emotions I have felt in the past few months.

- Jealousy
- Anger
- Calm but confused

The visual aspect of the piece is also a reflection of the emotions I have felt. However the song ended up to sound jumpy instead. In my opinion, it works anyway
I did 3 different codes first. I was inspired by GenerativeGestaltung and so I took some of the codes to the pieces and used that as a starting point. I then used the structure of those codes and made my own from there.

*Code 1*

The first code is inspired from a logo from a band called Bring Me The Horizon. Instead of having the circles stay in one place I wanted it to move around a create the mood of the song, which was sort of like a roller-coaster ride of feelings.

*Code 2*

The aim of the second code was to make it as trippy as I can get it to look. I created 4 draw modes to make it switch between 4 different themes to create a sort of hype between each visual.

*Code 3*

This piece was completely inspired from GenerativeGestaltung. I saw one of its pieces which was a random moving shape which can be controlled by a mouse. I took that code and edited it to have the background change and the shape to be filled with colours.

*Use of Duration*

After writing the song, I split the song into 3 parts to make it easier for editing in Duration. I used duration to trigger certain events in the code. For example, I used the Curves function to set the expansion of the shapes along to the music for Code 2. I used the Color function to run through the palette for the circles in Code 1. I used the Bangs function to trigger the background changes in Code 3.

*Conclusion*

I'm very happy with the end product because it looks much better than I expected it to be. The changes and triggers along to the song were really good in my opinion and I'm very happy with it.

If I had more time I would really like to work on the piece more to make it look visually impressive. I notice some of the parts were very draggy and I wished I had more time to work on it.
