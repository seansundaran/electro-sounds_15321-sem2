# Generative Music Video

## Trangulate

  - The title of my Generative Music Video will be called Trangulate, for reasons being that the song is called Trangulate.

  - The Trangulate MV will be generative through key presses. There will be different events happening that will be changed according to the beat of the music.
  - It will be a performance piece with different interactions controlled by keys on a keyboard.

  - There will be 5 different codes for 5 different segments of the piece, each with a different theme.
  - Each code will be interactive. 

  - I was very inspired by a video I came across called Visualising Sound by Joelle. [link](https://vimeo.com/68161863)
  - Here's an example of what I would like to include in my sketch       [Sean](https://s23.postimg.org/6w551jzbv/170314_111454_570.png) [Sean](https://s14.postimg.org/6mrjswp6p/Screen_Shot_2017_03_14_at_11_33_23_AM.png) [GenerativeGestaltung](https://s24.postimg.org/osd0yr7ed/P_2_2_3_02.png)
  - The soundtrack would approximately 2min 30secs
  - I will be going for the category B (camera reactive, audio reactive, shaders)
